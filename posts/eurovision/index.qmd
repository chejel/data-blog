## What is #TidyTuesday?

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly project that provides a dataset for R users to explore and visualize. On May 17, 2022, it featured a [Eurovision dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-17/readme.md).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext) # to highlight parts of the title in ggplot vis and other formatting
library(knitr) # for tables

eurovision <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-17/eurovision.csv')

# eurovision_edit <- eurovision %>%
#   select(host_city,year,host_country,section,artist,song,artist_country,running_order,total_points,rank) %>%
#   # remove 2020
#   filter(!year==2020)
```

## Exploring the dataset

## An American attempts to explain Eurovision
Every year, more than 40 countries across Europe, and from other continents, participate in the Eurovision Song Contest, a continent (and beyond)-wide extravaganza complete with sparkles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU" target="_blank">Hard Rock Hallelujah</a>. In the case of the dataset, it lists every artist and song performed on the show since the inaugural show in 1956. The competition has been held annually since then, except in 2020.
:::

A bit of wrangling of this dataset can give some insight into how the history of the competition and how it has changed through the decades to include more countries. Here's a glimpse of the original dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(eurovision)
```

To start off, how many countries have participated each year?

```{r}
# divide up years on x-axis by decades
decade_breaks <- c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)

eurovision %>%
  select(year, artist_country) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  count(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n)) + 
  geom_col(fill="#F7C04A", color="black", size=0.25, alpha=0.6, width=1, show.legend=FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1955,2023),
                     breaks=decade_breaks,
                     expand=c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0, 0), limits=c(0, 45)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family="DM Serif Display", size=rel(1.75)),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        legend.position = "top", 
        legend.justification = "left",
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill="#fff7f5", color=NA),
        legend.text = element_text(margin=margin(r=0.28, unit="cm"), size=10),
        legend.box.margin = margin(c(0,0,0,-77)),
        text = element_text(family="Trade Gothic LT Std", color="#313131"),
        plot.caption = element_textbox_simple(color="#666666"),
        axis.title = element_text(size=rel(0.75), color="#525E75"),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(size=0.15),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size=0.2)) +
  labs(title="Eurovision: Number of Participating Countries by Year",
       caption=NULL,
       x="Year",
       y="Number of countries")
```
<br />
Note: While the competition was not held in 2020, the list of participants had already been determined. Also, what happened in 1970?[^1]

[^1]: A "[voting scandal](https://eurovision.tv/event/amsterdam-1970)" the year before.

Each row of the dataset includes, among other details, the year, song and singer, as well as the stage of the competition in which the performance took place. A look into the data reveals how over the years, the contest has expanded to include more countries, which in turn led to multiple segments of the eshow.

Which years had which segments?
```{r}
eurovision %>%
  # keep only select variables
  select(host_city, year, host_country, section) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  # combine sections (ex. merge "semi-final" and "grand-final" rows that are in the same year into "semi-final, grand-final")
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(sections = paste0(section, collapse = ", ")) %>%
  # How many of each type of combination of competition sections?
  count(sections) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(sections) %>%
  # for each section, get the earliest and latest year to get range
  summarize(first_year = min(year), last_year = max(year)) %>%
  # sort by earliest year
  arrange(first_year) %>% 
  select(Sections=sections, `Earliest year`=first_year, `Latest year`=last_year) %>%
  kable()
```
<br />
**Results**: For nearly 50 years, the competition included only one level, the "final" show. In 2004, following an influx of new participating countries, organizers introduced the semi-final stage, the top 10 of which proceeded to the final â€“ along with the top 10 from the 2003 final, the host country and the five automatically qualifying countries of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. 

In 2008, the competition started holding two simultaneous semi-finals with qualifiers from each section (along with ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and the host country) making up the finalists.[^2]

As evident in the dataset, only in 1956 did each of the participating countries (seven at the time) have two performances, either performed by the same or different people, with only two rankings in the end: One entry, representing the host country of Switzerland, (Lys Assia performing Refrain) placed first while the other 13 performances placed "second," at least in the sense that ranked results beyond the winner were not announced.

```{r}
eurovision %>%
  filter(year==1956) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  select(Artist=artist, Song=song, `Artist's Country`=artist_country, Rank=rank) %>%
  kable()
```


## Visualization

The visualization will include only the countries that have made it to at least one final stage of a competition. I have manipulated the data accordingly. Here's a random sample of the result:
```{r}
eurovision_plot <- eurovision %>%
  select(year, section, artist_country, rank) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  # narrow down to winners and non-winners
  filter(section=="final" | section=="grand-final") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  # remove non-winners of 1956 as other ranks were not specified
  filter(!(year==1956 & rank==1)) %>% 
  arrange(-year) %>% # order by most recent
  # assign placement to make it easier to assign color
  mutate(rank_text = case_when(
    rank==1 ~ "First",
    rank==2 ~ "Second",
    rank==3 ~ "Third",
    rank==max(rank)-2 ~ "Bottom 3",
    rank==max(rank)-1 ~ "Bottom 3",
    rank==max(rank) ~ "Bottom 3")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(artist_country, year, rank, rank_text) %>% 
  arrange(artist_country)

eurovision_plot %>% 
  select(Country=artist_country, Year=year, Rank=rank, `Rank group`=rank_text) %>%
  sample_n(5) %>%
  kable()
```
<br />

Are there any countries that never made it to a final stage?
```{r}
setdiff(eurovision$artist_country, eurovision_plot$artist_country) %>%
  sort() %>% # alphabetize
  paste0(., collapse = ", ") # transform to single element of countries separated by commas that can be selected and copied into the ggplot code
```
