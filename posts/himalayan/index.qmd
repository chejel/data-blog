## What is #TidyTuesday?

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly project that provides a dataset for R users to explore and visualize. On September 22, 2020, it [featured data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/readme.md) from [The Himalayan Database](https://www.himalayandatabase.com/), which contains information on expeditions from 1905 through spring 2019 (the online database itself goes up to spring 2021) that scaled more than 465 major peaks in the Nepal Himalayas. 
:::

According to the Himalayan Database:

> The database is based on the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime journalist based in Kathmandu, and it is supplemented by information gathered from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers.  
> (...)  
> Each expedition record contains detailed information including dates, routes, camps, use of supplemental oxygen, successes, deaths and accidents.  
>  
> Each expedition record contains biographical information for all members listed on the permit as well as for hired members (e.g., Sherpas) for which there are significant events such as a summit success, death, accident or rescue.

This post shows the exploration process of two of the datasets, and uses the `tidyverse` set of R packages for data wrangling and visualization.

Starting out with an overview of the records:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(DT) # for displaying tables via datatable()

# loading data
expeditions <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/expeditions.csv')

members <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/members.csv')
```

```{r}
glimpse(expeditions)
```

```{r}
glimpse(members)
```

Given that each record is of a member of an expedition, how many different expeditions occurred, according to the datasets?

For `expeditions`, will each row be a unique expedition?
```{r}
expeditions %>% count(expedition_id, sort=TRUE)
```
Since `KANG10101` appears twice, how do those rows appear?
```{r}
expeditions %>%
  filter(expedition_id=="KANG10101") %>%
  datatable(options = list(dom = 't', scrollX = TRUE))
```

They are indeed two different expeditions, a century apart. How many other expeditions have missing values? I'll use a function from the `[naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/)` package, which shows the number and percentage of missing values for each variable.
```{r}
naniar::miss_var_summary(expeditions)
```
For expeditions without a basecamp date, were the reasons?

```{r}
expeditions %>%
  filter(is.na(basecamp_date)) %>%
  count(termination_reason)
```
Though these trips did not happen in the end, they're still considered expeditions and `KANG10101` as two distinct expeditions. How does this ID appear in the `members` dataset? Are the two years present there too? (Yes.)
```{r}
members %>%
  filter(expedition_id=="KANG10101")
```

Is every expedition listed in `expeditions` also in `members`? I'll use the `setdiff()` function to see if any IDs from `expeditions` are not found in `members`.
```{r}
setdiff(expeditions$expedition_id, members$expedition_id)
```

There are 13. Any particular commonalities between those expeditions?
```{r}
expeditions_only <- setdiff(expeditions$expedition_id, members$expedition_id) # creates a character string

expeditions %>% 
  filter(expedition_id %in% expeditions_only)
# ANN186305
```
The expeditions range from 1924 through the 1980s, and one from 2019. That one from 2019 is the only successful trip (termination date not available possibly due to it occurring after the end date of the dataset timeframe) while the rest were either rumored attempts or climbs that were not attempted, with one expedition not reaching the base camp.

Any IDs found in `members` but not in `expeditions`? (No)
```{r}
setdiff(members$expedition_id, expeditions$expedition_id)
```

Therefore, the number of *unique* expedition IDs in the `members` data (which has a total 76,519 rows) should be 13 less than number of *unique* observations in the `expeditions` data (which, as found earlier, has 10,364 with one "duplicate" ID).
```{r}
members %>%
  count(expedition_id, sort=TRUE)
```
Going forward, I'll focus on the `year`, `season`, `age`, `citizenship` and `gender` variables in creating the visualizations. The `expedition role` specifies the titles of each individuals, with the most commons ones being `climber`, `H-A worker`, `leader`, `expedition doctor` and `deputy leader`. In this post all individuals will be referred to as `climbers`.

### Seasons and decades

Do the expeditions tend to occur during certain seasons and has that been the case throughout the decades?

```{r}
#| warning: false
expeditions %>%
  mutate(decade = case_when(
    year >= "1900" & year <= "1909" ~ "1900-'09",
    year >= "1910" & year <= "1919" ~ "'10-'19",
    year >= "1920" & year <= "1929" ~ "'20-'29",
    year >= "1930" & year <= "1939" ~ "'30-'39",
    year >= "1940" & year <= "1949" ~ "'40-'49",
    year >= "1950" & year <= "1959" ~ "'50-'59",
    year >= "1960" & year <= "1969" ~ "'60-'69",
    year >= "1970" & year <= "1979" ~ "'70-'79",
    year >= "1980" & year <= "1989" ~ "'80-'89",
    year >= "1990" & year <= "1999" ~ "'90-'99",
    year >= "2000" & year <= "2009" ~ "2000-'09",
    year >= "2010" & year <= "2019" ~ " '10-'19 ",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::ymd(year, truncated = 2L)) %>%
  filter(season != "Unknown") %>%
  mutate(season = factor(season, levels=c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"))) %>%
  mutate(decade = factor(decade, levels=c("1900-'09", "'10-'19", "'20-'29", "'30-'39", "'40-'49", "'50-'59", "'60-'69", "'70-'79", "'80-'89", "'90-'99", "2000-'09", " '10-'19 "))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(decade, ..count.., fill = season)) +
    geom_bar(width = 0.7, alpha = 0.9) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), labels = scales::comma_format()) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#4e89ae", "#fe7171", "#f0a500", "#7ea04d")) +
    annotate("text", label = "Winter expeditions\npeaked in the '80s",
             x = 5, y = 1150, size = 3.5, color = "#4e89ae", family="Commissioner", hjust = 0) +
    geom_segment(aes(x = 7.5, y = 1140, xend = 8.4, yend = 1140),
                 size = 0.45, color = "#4e89ae",
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, "mm"))) +
    annotate("text", label = "In the '80s and '90s,\nautumn expeditions\noutnumbered those\nin the spring", 
             x = 7.5, y = 2200, size = 3.5, color = "#7ea04d", family="Commissioner", hjust = 0) +
    theme_linedraw() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
                   plot.title.position = "plot",
                   plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
                   legend.position = "top", 
                   legend.justification = "left",
                   legend.direction = "horizontal",
                   legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
                   legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(r = 0.28, unit = 'cm'), size = 10),
                   legend.box.margin = margin(c(0,0,0,-54)),
                   text = element_text(family = "Commissioner"),
                   panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
                   panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = "Number of expeditions",
         title = "Slight Seasonal Shifts Over Decades of Expeditions",
         subtitle = "Expeditions span 1905-2019",
         fill = NULL,
         caption = "Source: #TidyTuesday | Himalayan Database")
```

Rather than relying solely on eyeballing the seasonal proportions, here are the actual percentages listed in tabular form (using the [DT package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)). Now it's clear more spring expeditions occurred in every decade except for the 1980s and 1990s, during which the autumn months dominated.
```{r}
library(DT)

expeditions %>%
  mutate(decade = case_when(
    year >= "1900" & year <= "1909" ~ "1900-1909",
    year >= "1910" & year <= "1919" ~ "1910-1919",
    year >= "1920" & year <= "1929" ~ "1920-1929",
    year >= "1930" & year <= "1939" ~ "1930-1939",
    year >= "1940" & year <= "1949" ~ "1940-1949",
    year >= "1950" & year <= "1959" ~ "1950-1959",
    year >= "1960" & year <= "1969" ~ "1960-1969",
    year >= "1970" & year <= "1979" ~ "1970-1979",
    year >= "1980" & year <= "1989" ~ "1980-1989",
    year >= "1990" & year <= "1999" ~ "1990-1999",
    year >= "2000" & year <= "2009" ~ "2000-2009",
    year >= "2010" & year <= "2019" ~ "2010-2019 ",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::ymd(year, truncated = 2L)) %>%
  filter(season != "Unknown") %>%
  count(decade, season) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  mutate(pct = round((n/sum(n)*100), digits=1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(season, pct) %>% 
  select(Deacde = decade, Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) %>%
  mutate(Winter = replace_na(Winter, "-")) %>%
  mutate(Spring = replace_na(Spring, "-")) %>%
  mutate(Summer = replace_na(Summer, "-")) %>%
  mutate(Autumn = replace_na(Autumn, "-")) %>% 
  datatable(options = list(dom = 't',
                           pageLength = nrow(.)))
```

The rest of the charts focus on the `citizenship` variable which lists the country or countries of origin for the climbers. Only 10 out of the more than 76,500 expeditions do not have a country or countries listed for the climber. The charts do not include individuals with more than one country of citizenship listed.

First, I'm creating a custom theme (based on the bar chart above) that I'll use in addition to `theme_linedraw()`.
```{r}
theme_him <- theme_linedraw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
                   plot.title.position = "plot",
                   plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
                   legend.position = "top", 
                   legend.justification = "left",
                   legend.direction = "horizontal",
                   legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
                   legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(r = 0.28, unit = 'cm'), size = 10),
                   legend.box.margin = margin(c(0,0,0,-77)),
                   text = element_text(family = "Commissioner"),
                   axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
                   panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
                   panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
  
```

Do expeditions tend to happen during certain seasons?

    geom_segment(aes(x = 21, y = 7700, xend = 21, yend = 6700),

    geom_segment(aes(x = 19, y = 5900, xend = 19, yend = 4900),

         fill = NULL,
         caption = "Source: #TidyTuesday | Himalayan Database") +
    coord_flip()
```

While the earlier chart showed that overall, more expeditions occurred in the spring, breaking the data down by countries reveals distinctions, as noted above.

### Trips by decades

The next bar chart visualizes the number of trips per 20-year time frames. While the majority of the countries with at least 500 climbers had the largest proportion of trips occur in 2000-2019, take a look at those that did not.

```{r}

         fill = NULL,
         caption = "Source: #TidyTuesday | Himalayan Database") +
    coord_flip()
```

Here are the specific percentages by decade. About half the trips recorded in the dataset occurred between 2000 and 2019.
```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(decade = case_when(
    year >= "1900" & year <= "1909" ~ "1900-1909",
    year >= "1910" & year <= "1919" ~ "1910-1919",
    year >= "1920" & year <= "1929" ~ "1920-1929",
    year >= "1930" & year <= "1939" ~ "1930-1939",
    year >= "1940" & year <= "1949" ~ "1940-1949",
    year >= "1950" & year <= "1959" ~ "1950-1959",

    year >= "2000" & year <= "2009" ~ "2000-2009",
    year >= "2010" & year <= "2019" ~ "2010-2019",
    TRUE ~ "NA")) %>%
  count(decade, sort=T) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(n/sum(n)*100, digit=1))
```


### Age factor

Asian countries continue to divert from the overall trends of the group of countries, particularly in the case of climber age. Missing values, which for the age variable make up about 4.6%, have been excluded from the chart. Unsurprisingly, the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups make up the largest proportions.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= "17" ~ "Under 18",
    age >= "18" & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= "25" & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= "35" & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= "45" & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= "55" & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= "65" ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%

  mutate(age_range = factor(age_range, levels=c("Under 18", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"))) %>%
  mutate(citizenship = fct_reorder(citizenship, n_country)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(citizenship, n, fill = age_range)) +
    geom_col(position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)) +

Given the age distinction with Japan, out of all of the country's climbers, how many, percentage-wise, are older than 65? 6% (To put the number in perspective, the table includes countries with percentages > 1 and number of expeditions > 9. )

```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= "17" ~ "Under 18",
    age >= "18" & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= "25" & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= "35" & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= "45" & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= "55" & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= "65" ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  filter(age_range != "Unknown") %>%
  count(citizenship, age_range, sort=T) %>%
  group_by(citizenship) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(n/sum(n)*100)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(age_range == "65+" & pct > 1 & n > 9) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  select(-age_range)
```
<hr />
Framed another way, what percentage of all climbers older than 65 are Japanese? 38.7% (The table includes the countries with the 10 highest percentages.)

```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= "17" ~ "Under 18",
    age >= "18" & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= "25" & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= "35" & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= "45" & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= "55" & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= "65" ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  filter(age_range != "Unknown") %>%
  count(citizenship, age_range, sort=T) %>%
  filter(age_range == "65+") %>%
  mutate(pct_65 = round(n/sum(n)*100, digits=1)) %>%
  select(-age_range) %>%
  head(10)
```

<hr />
On the other end of the age spectrum, what percentage of climbers 18-24 years of age come from Asian countries? 66% (The table includes only countries where 18-24 year olds make up at least 1% of climbers.)

```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= "17" ~ "Under 18",
    age >= "18" & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= "25" & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= "35" & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= "45" & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= "55" & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= "65" ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  filter(age_range != "Unknown") %>%
  count(citizenship, age_range, sort=T) %>%
  filter(age_range == "18-24") %>%
  mutate(pct_1824 = round(n/sum(n)*100)) %>%
  filter(citizenship %in% c("Bangladesh", "Bhutan", "China", "India", "Indonesia", "Iran", "Israel", "Japan", "Kazakhstan", "Kuwait", "Malaysia", "Nepal", "Pakistan", "S Korea", "Singapore", "Taiwan", "Uzbekistan", "Vietnam") & pct_1824 >= 1) %>%
  select(-age_range)
```
<hr />
Are Asian countries indeed the ones with the highest percentages of climbers 18-24 years of age? Yes, China leads the list with 20% of its climbers within the age group, while Slovenia is the only non-Asian country in which the age group makes up a double-digit percentage, at 11%. Countries with trips numbering fewer than 10 have been removed from the list.

```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= "17" ~ "Under 18",
    age >= "18" & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= "25" & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= "35" & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= "45" & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= "55" & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= "65" ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  filter(age_range != "Unknown") %>%

How many climbers in the dataset are under 18? Out of 76,519 expeditions, 124 of them were undertaken teenagers, while two are even younger at the age of 7 (Italian, 1984) and 12 (Nepalese, 1984). See the breakdown by age group.

```{r}
members %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    age <= 17 ~ "Under 18",
    age >= 18 & age <= "24" ~ "18-24",
    age >= 25 & age <= "34" ~ "25-34",
    age >= 35 & age <= "44" ~ "35-44",
    age >= 45 & age <= "54" ~ "45-54",
    age >= 55 & age <= "64" ~ "55-64",
    age >= 65 ~ "65+",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>%
  filter(age_range != "Unknown") %>%
  count(age_range, sort=T) %>%
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)*100)
```

### Women Climbers
The final visualization looks at the percentage of expeditions taken by women, by country while also giving an overview of the countries (that have had women climbers) represented in the dataset. 

This code sets up a world map base layer using the `rnaturalearth` package. 
```{r}
library(rnaturalearth)

world_map <- ne_countries(scale="medium",
					type="countries",
					returnclass="sf")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=world_map, size=0.25, fill="#fafafa") +
  theme_void()
```

The following produces a dataframe showing the percentage of expeditions by women, based on country. Only countries with at least 10 women are included. I'll join this subset with the map data.
```{r}
expeditions_women <- members %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == "F", "Women", "Men")) %>%
  filter(sex != "NA") %>%
  count(citizenship, sex) %>%
  group_by(citizenship) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(n/sum(n)*100)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sex = factor(sex, levels=c("Men", "Women"))) %>%
  filter(sex=="Women" & n > 9 & !str_detect(citizenship, "/")) # remove dual-country citizenship
```

Now checking for which country names do not match and thus have to be edited in the `expeditions_women` dataframe, using `setdiff()`. This line asks: What country names in the citizenship column of the subset *are not* in the country names in the map data?
```{r}
setdiff(expeditions_women$citizenship, world_map$geounit)
```

Based on the results, I'm removing the country names that no longer exist and renaming the rest.
```{r}
expeditions_women <- expeditions_women %>%
  # removing country names that no longer exist
  filter(!str_detect(citizenship, "Czechoslovakia|USSR|W Germany|Yugoslavia")) %>%
  # renaming countries
  mutate(citizenship = str_replace_all(
    citizenship,
    c(
      "Bosnia-Herzegovina" = "Bosnia and Herzegovina",
      "S Africa" = "South Africa",
      "S Korea" = "South Korea",
      "Serbia" = "Republic of Serbia",
      "UK" = "United Kingdom",
      "USA" = "United States of America"
    )
  ))

# check > should have no results
setdiff(expeditions_women$citizenship, world_map$geounit)
```

Here is a table of the final 49 countries, sorted by the percentage of expeditions involving women.
```{r}
expeditions_women %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  select(-sex) %>%
  select(Citizenship=citizenship, `# of expeditions, women`=n, `% of all expeditions`=pct) %>%
  datatable()
```
With the exception of Norway, the countries where women make up more than 20% of the expeditions have relatively low numbers, with the number of women under 50. Most of them also happen to be small countries, area-wise, so they are not immediately visible on the map. Instead, you see swaths of yellow with subtle variations, signifying percentages of expeditions with women in the teens or lower.

```{r}
#| warning: false
# join map layer with countries in Himalayan dataset
expeditions_women_maplayer <- world_map %>%
  right_join(expeditions_women, by=c("geounit"="citizenship"))

map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=world_map, size=0.25, color="#888888", fill="#f9f9f9") +
  geom_sf(data=expeditions_women_maplayer, size=0.25, color="#888888", aes(fill=pct)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#ffff3f", high = "#007f5f") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        legend.position = "top", 
        legend.justification = "center",
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        text = element_text(family = "Commissioner"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
        legend.spacing.x = unit(0.4, 'cm')) +
  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title.vjust = 0.75, barheight = 1)) +
  labs(fill="% of Women",
       title="Expeditions Undertaken by Women",
       subtitle="Includes countries with at least 10 expeditions by women\n",
       caption = "Source: #TidyTuesday | Himalayan Database")

# completely fill background with specified page color (eliminating white bands as happened when only running the plot)
# https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/269224/ggplot2-map-with-colored-background-and-coord-map
cowplot::ggdraw(map) + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill="#fff7f5", color = NA))
```

A larger map would improve the visibility of the smaller countries but given the format constraints of this page, I'll try grouping the percentages and using more distinct colors for the ramp.
```{r}
# range of % values
expeditions_women %>%
  summary()
```

Percentages run from 1-83 but was is the distribution (in order to know the which percentage groups to make)?
```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
expeditions_women %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pct)) +
    geom_histogram(stat="count", alpha=0.8, fill="#333C83") +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    theme_him
```

With most of the percentages clustered under 20, I'll create the groups as follows:
```{r}
exp_women_v2 <- expeditions_women %>%
  mutate(pct_group = case_when(
    pct <= 10 ~ "1-10",
    pct > 10 & pct <= 20 ~ "11-20",
    pct > 20 ~ "More than 20")) %>%
  # to set order for colors
  mutate(pct_group = factor(pct_group, levels=c("1-10", "11-20", "More than 20")))

exp_women_v2
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
exp_women_maplayer_v2 <- world_map %>%
  right_join(exp_women_v2, by=c("geounit"="citizenship"))

map_v2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=world_map, size=0.25, color="#888888", fill="#f9f9f9") +
  geom_sf(data=exp_women_maplayer_v2, size=0.15, color="#888888", alpha=0.7, aes(fill=pct_group)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#fcbf49", "#f77f00", "#d62828")) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        legend.position = "top", 
        legend.justification = "left",
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(r=0.25, unit="cm"), size = 10),
        text = element_text(family = "Commissioner"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff7f5", color = NA),
        legend.box.margin = margin(c(0,0,0,-2))
        #legend.spacing.x = unit(0.25, 'cm')
        ) +
  labs(fill=NULL,
       title="% of Expeditions Undertaken by Women",
       subtitle="Includes countries with at least 10 expeditions by women\n",
       caption = "Source: #TidyTuesday | Himalayan Database")

# completely fill background with specified page color (eliminating white bands as happened when only running the plot)
# https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/269224/ggplot2-map-with-colored-background-and-coord-map
cowplot::ggdraw(map_v2) + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill="#fff7f5", color = NA))
```
